            <h2>MISSION</h2><br>
            When you're challenged to the extreme, you learn so much about yourself. And when you're willing to give that ultimate sacrifice, when you're willing to tackle a job or a task or a mission head-on and give 100%, you can achieve amazing things because you're almost fearless.</div>

            <h2>VISSION</h2><br>
            “Don’t let others tell you what you can’t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible.”
            ― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart</div>

            <h2>GOALS</h2><br>
            "If you’re bored with life – you don’t get up every morning with a burning desire to do things – you don’t have enough goals."  Having goals that we are passionate about gives us something to look forward to each and every morning when we wake up.
